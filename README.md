# Full-Stack Development Roadmap

This repository contains my journey to becoming a full-stack developer, focusing on React, NodeJS, ExpressJS, and MongoDB. Below is a structured roadmap with detailed learning paths and project implementations.

## Frontend Development with React

### Basics of JavaScript and React
- **JavaScript Refresh**: Review ES6+ concepts like arrow functions, promises, async/await, destructuring, and modules.
  - Resources: [MDN Web Docs - JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
- **React Basics**: Introduction to React, JSX, components, props, and state.
  - Resources: [React Official Documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)

### Advanced React Concepts
- **React Router**: Learn how to implement routing in React applications.
  - Resources: [React Router Documentation](https://reactrouter.com/)
- **State Management**: Learn about context API and Redux for state management.
  - Resources: [Redux Documentation](https://redux.js.org/)

### Building a React Project
- **Project Setup**: Set up a simple project using Create React App.
- **UI Components**: Create and style components.
- **API Integration**: Fetch data from a public API and display it in your components.
  - Resources: [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)

### React Project Enhancement
- **Authentication**: Implement basic authentication (login/signup) using local storage or mock API.
- **Forms and Validation**: Handle forms and validate user input.
- **Deployment**: Deploy your React app on a platform like Netlify or Vercel.

## Backend Development with NodeJS, ExpressJS, and MongoDB

### Basics of NodeJS and ExpressJS
- **NodeJS Basics**: Learn the fundamentals of NodeJS, including the event loop, asynchronous programming, and modules.
  - Resources: [NodeJS Official Documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/)
- **ExpressJS Basics**: Introduction to ExpressJS, setting up a server, and handling routes.
  - Resources: [ExpressJS Official Documentation](https://expressjs.com/)

### MongoDB and Mongoose
- **MongoDB Basics**: Learn the basics of MongoDB, including CRUD operations.
  - Resources: [MongoDB Official Documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/)
- **Mongoose**: Learn how to interact with MongoDB using Mongoose.
  - Resources: [Mongoose Documentation](https://mongoosejs.com/)

### Building a Backend Project
- **API Development**: Build RESTful APIs with ExpressJS and MongoDB.
- **Authentication**: Implement user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
  - Resources: [JWT Documentation](https://jwt.io/introduction/)

### Full-Stack Integration and Deployment
- **Connecting Frontend and Backend**: Integrate your React frontend with the NodeJS/ExpressJS backend.
- **Final Project**: Build a full-stack project that includes user authentication, CRUD operations, and API integration.
- **Deployment**: Deploy your full-stack application using a service like Heroku for the backend and Netlify or Vercel for the frontend.
